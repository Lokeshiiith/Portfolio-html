                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Lokesh Sharma, a passionate and dedicated professional in the field of Computer Science
                    and Engineering.
                </p>
                <p class="portfolio-text">
                    My expertise lies in languages like C, C++, Python, and Racket, coupled with hands-on experience in
                    HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, and React. Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from
                    distributed IoT
                    platforms
                    to peer-to-peer file transfer systems, demonstrating my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

                    I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad, where I delved
                    deep into advanced
                    topics like Data
                    Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Software Systems Development. My academic journey
                    has been
                    complemented by practical experiences, collaborative projects, which have equipped me with a
                    robust skill set and a passion for continuous learning.

                    In addition to my technical skills, I am adept at version control systems like Git and GitHub, and I
                    have a strong
                    foundation in system design principles and software development methodologies. I thrive in
                    collaborative
                    environments,
                    where I can leverage my critical thinking abilities and creative problem-solving skills to drive
                    innovation and
                    achieve
                    results.
